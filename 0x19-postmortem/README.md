# Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**

- **Start:** June 10, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
- **End:** June 10, 2024, 1:00 PM UTC

**Impact:**

- Our primary e-commerce service was down, preventing users from accessing the website and completing transactions.
- Approximately 85% of our user base experienced disruptions, with the remaining 15% facing significant slowdowns.

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured load balancer that failed to distribute incoming traffic properly, leading to server overload and eventual crash.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating unusually high server load and increased error rates.
- **10:05 AM:** On-call engineer notified of the issue via automated alerting system.
- **10:10 AM:** Initial investigation began; assumption that the database was under heavy load.
- **10:20 AM:** Database team engaged to check for slow queries and possible bottlenecks.
- **10:40 AM:** Misleading path identified; database performance was normal.
- **11:00 AM:** Web server logs analyzed; noticed repetitive patterns of 502 Bad Gateway errors.
- **11:15 AM:** Network team brought in to investigate potential network-related issues.
- **11:30 AM:** Load balancer logs reviewed, revealing a misconfiguration in the traffic routing rules.
- **11:45 AM:** Escalation to the infrastructure team to reconfigure the load balancer.
- **12:00 PM:** Load balancer reconfigured, and traffic routing normalized.
- **12:30 PM:** Gradual recovery observed as servers began to stabilize.
- **1:00 PM:** Full service restored; monitoring confirmed normal operational metrics.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**

- The load balancer was misconfigured due to a recent deployment that inadvertently changed the traffic distribution rules. This configuration error caused the load balancer to route all incoming traffic to a single server instance rather than distributing it across multiple instances, leading to server overload and crash.

**Resolution:**

- The infrastructure team identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The erroneous routing rules were corrected to ensure proper distribution of traffic across all server instances. Once the configuration was updated, the servers began to recover, and normal service was gradually restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**

- Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect load balancer configuration issues.
- Implement a more rigorous review process for deployment changes that impact critical infrastructure components.
- Conduct training sessions for engineers on the importance of thorough configuration checks.

**Specific Tasks:**

- Patch the load balancer configuration and add validation checks to prevent similar errors.
- Develop and deploy monitoring scripts that specifically track load balancer health and traffic distribution metrics.
- Update the deployment pipeline to include automated tests for load balancer configurations.
- Schedule regular audits of infrastructure settings to ensure compliance with best practices.
- Create documentation outlining standard procedures for load balancer configuration and maintenance.

By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve overall system resilience and reliability.
